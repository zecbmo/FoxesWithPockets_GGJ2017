Four young life-forms had 5 grenades each. They were playing a game of throwing the grenades through a portal. One of the young ones died when tragicallly hit by a grenade. Who killed him?

Alien 1: I managed to throw three grenades into the portal but one missed
Alien 2: I was so terrible that all five of my grenades missed.
Alien 3: I only missed one shot and threw four in.

(KID 1 KILLED KID 2)


It was the first day of space school when a young life-form was found dead. We've narrowed it down to four suspects.

Alien 1: I was in my office the whole day, this is preposterous.
Alien 2: I've been marking grades. My life in academia is so hard! 
Alien 3: I was carrying mail around the space school like a space donkey.
Alien 4: I was chilling on the roof. No sweat, man.

Alien 2 did it - first day of school so no grades to mark.
